# This file is auto-generated from the current state of the database. Instead
# of editing this file, please use the migrations feature of ActiveNode to
# incrementally modify your database, and then regenerate this schema definition.
#
# Note that this schema.yml definition is the authoritative source for your
# database schema. If you need to create the application database on another
# system, you should be using neo4j:schema:load, not running all the migrations
# from scratch. The latter is a flawed and unsustainable approach (the more migrations
# you'll amass, the slower it'll run and the greater likelihood for issues).
#
# It's strongly recommended that you check this file into your version control system.
